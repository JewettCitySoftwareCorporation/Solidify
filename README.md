I appreciate your time and having me in, please let me know if I can help you grow.<br />

Could you ask Del Merenda if he remebers Walter Dempsy?  He was a professor at Eastern I learned a ton of valuable information he was an early IT leader at Pratt & whitney.  


And some advise to help you exceed your organization's growth requirments, Do you know who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GrantCardone">Grant Cardone</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GaryVaynerchuk">Gary Vaynerchuk</a> are?<br /><br /><a href="https://grantcardone.com/fight-against-obscurity/">fight-against-obscurity</a> is paramount for maintaining sucess.<br />  
I think you should take a couple minutes and utilize SteemIt.<br />
<a href="https://steemit.com">steemit.com/@Solidify</a>  -- SteemIt is an Imutable Blockchain of knowledge, a database that is searchable & indexed.  This is a great place to create LinbkBacks, Inform new customers of offerings, and market into the future to those searching for the services your organization offers.
There is a $$ concept to SteemIt yes, but it is irrelivant, if you do you do, but from a marketing and cost to deploy standpoint the possibilities are endless.  Yes you could automate posts, but the human touch creates better image for the Brand you are trying to build, and each post can be tailored to cetrian problems your solutions solve.  Giving you more Linkable Content that funnels customers back to your products and services and gets your Brand infron of more potential customers as they browse the ecosystem.  The fact you can earn a few pennies for your organizations thoughts pales in comparison to the marketing impact, and getting your Brand to Solidify into new customers.
<br /><br /><hr />
I hope this documentation & prototypes help you at this client meeting, Let me know what else you need,<br />
~Luke
